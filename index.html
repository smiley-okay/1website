<h2 class="western">This Site</h2>
<p>This is my first attempt at a website, let's see how it goes</p>
<h2 class="western">My goals</h2>
<p>I'm working on developing my own server to host my digital life .</p>
<p>So far I’ve developed my own server using Proxmox and have been
able to host my own files.</p>
<p>Develop a vm that is accesable online</p>
<hr/>

<p><b>09/02/2024</b></p>
<p>I also managed to allow myself to host virtual machines in
Proxmox.</p>
<p>I think my next goal is to make the vm accessable wherever I go
using something like teamviewer.</p>
<p>I’m currently writing this while the power is out and a moth
managed to fly directly into my tea light candle and extinguish it.</p>
